        Hi there, my name is Joyce! I am a current part-time graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley studying data science and software engineering. 
        I have a strong interest in building and integrating machine learning tools into my life's work, whether that be in the tech industry, biopharmaceutical space, or other business sectors; I want to explore it all! 
        Particularly, I want to learn more about our world through the data that describes it; and where I can help make a positive impact with the skills I've learned along the way.
        If you would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach me at <a href="mailto:joyceyu579@berkeley.edu" style="color: purple;">joyceyu579@berkeley.edu</a> .

                    Inspired by the RDKit library, I used python to develop my own library and molecular fingerprinting algorithm that enables users to perform substructure searches 
                    via the terminal and BASH commands for my final project in the CHEM274A course at UC Berkeley. In addition, this program is capable of generating visuals to obtain graph representation of user-chosen molecules. 
                    It also assists the user in identifying other molecular properties such as different functional groups, aromatic structures, and features using graph traversal algorithms. 

                    <br><br>Included in the repository are additional files used to draft the main program:
                    <br>- A python file where I imeplement the depth-first-search algorithm to detect unique cycles in a ring, and to gain a better understanding of how libraries like RDKit and NetworkX uses DFS/BFS to detect cycles in aromatic compounds.
                    <br>- A python parser file (generously provided by UC Berkeley CHEM274A course instructors) used to parse .sdf files. 
                    <br>- A C++ program (.cpp, .hpp, and .tpp files) used to compare graph representations, traversals, and computations of molecules using the Eigen library in C++ vs. NetworkX library in Python

                    In collaboration with 2 other engineers, we've modeled lennard-jones fluidic systems, simulated particles in motion via Monte Carlo methods, and refactored scripts using Python Standard Library into NumPy and C++ for our final project in CHEM280 at UC Berkeley. 
                    To evaluate the space and run time complexity of our programs, and to assess the performance of our refactored scripts, BASH commands were used to time and compile our programs that can be used
                    to compute the energy of particles in motion, and to make accurate predictions of larger systems through molecular dynamic simulations.

                    The application also keeps a historical record of transactions and prevents users from creating invalid or dangerous executions (i.e. overdrafts, duplicate withdrawals, etc.). 
                    This application has gone through a series of tests to ensure its usability by business owners who may want to implement a purchasing or bank-like system.

                    This repository contains an interactive data visualization tool that I built using Python and HTML. It was made specifically for employees and customers of Curia Global's Antibody Discovery team starting in August 2023. 
                    The purpose is to summarize data and visualize a common workflow used by pharmaceutical companies for antibody research and development. 
                    The interactive visualization tool is capable of summarizing ~6 months worth of wet-lab data into one flow diagram and captures more than 5 different types of data (passage of time, genetic strains of animals, sequencing information of top drug candidates, screening results, drug characterization data, and more.)
                    
                    <br><br>During this intitative of introducing new tools into the workplace, 
                    I worked wih the research team and Curia's IT/cybersecurity department to ensure compliancy with all company and client data; 
                    and taught bash/python basics to advance the skills of older colleagues/scientists.
                    
                    <br><br>Most importantly, the interactive visualization tool can be used to track the origins of the company's products and serves as a deliverable to clients.
