            As the NGS Application Developer on the POBOT team at Exact Sciences, I developed a suite of CLI tools using Python, Bash, and Nextflow, leveraging cloud computing services, high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, and existing bioinformatics tools and Python libraries to build software for genomic data simulation. These tools facilitated the development of variant calling algorithms, diagnostic studies, and the maintenance of bioinformatics pipelines in the OncoExTra product.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I implemented CI/CD processes with GitLab and contributed to the development of automated testing frameworks, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of bioinformatics analyses. I also presented project results to stakeholders of the BBDS (Biological and Bioinformatics Data Science) pillar at the San Diego office location, demonstrating technical solutions and their impact on precision oncology workflows.
            <br><br>
            Beyond development, I actively engaged in journal clubs featuring live demonstrations of emerging AI tools (e.g., Perplexity, MCPs, Biomni, etc.), gaining exposure to cutting-edge technologies and best practices in bioinformatics. My work supported the advancement of novel algorithms, validation studies, and precision oncology solutions enabling personalized treatment strategies for cancer patients.

            In this project, my team and I built a machine learning pipeline to match breast cancer patients with 
            personalized anti-cancer therapeutics and predicted their potential treatment responses.
             <br><br>

            Our dataset comprised 204,026 breast cancer patients and incorporated 86 clinical, experimental, and drug-related features aggregated 
            from multiple heterogeneous sources. The raw data required extensive cleaning, normalization, and integration to ensure quality and comparability across studies. 
            This process included resolving missing values, unifying feature definitions, and harmonizing measurement scales to form a single, consistent analytical dataset. <br><br>

            In addition, We utilized machine learning and advanced data processing techniques to analyze complex, multi-source datasets consisting 86 dimensions. 
            This included dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, UMAP), feature attraction of drug 
            characterization metrics (IC50 calculations, PK/PD measures), and a suite of machine learning algorithms (e.g. Gaussian Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbors, feed-forward neural networks, binary classifiers, and k-fold cross-validation)
            to build predictive models for personalized anti-cancer therapeutics and patient treatment response.

                <p class = project-paragraph>
                    This project applied natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to evaluate and interpret the performance of 
                    28 distinct chatbots and large language models (LLMs) across a diverse set of questions and responses.<br><br> 
                    My team's analysis began with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate embedded response vectors, extracting meaningful patterns and relationships within the data.
                    To enhance our feature space and interpretability, we employed one-hot encoding for categorical variables, K-means clustering, calculated ELO ratings,
                    Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and statistical feature extraction. For performance assessment and robustness, we incorporated different types of regression testing (linear, logisitic, lasso, and ridge), 
                    confusion matrices, k-fold cross-validation, and various visualization tools (histograms, kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, box-and-whisker plots, and waterfall diagrams).<br><br> 
                    Our results demonstrated that embedded NLP features combined with statistical models can effectively predict competitive chatbot outcomes and quantify question difficulty, offering a data-driven framework for evaluating the capabilities of conversational AI systems.

                    This repository contains an interactive data visualization tool that I built using Python and HTML. It was made specifically for employees and customers of Curia Global's Antibody Discovery team starting in August 2023. 
                    The purpose is to summarize data and visualize a common workflow used by pharmaceutical companies for antibody research and development. 
                    The interactive visualization tool is capable of summarizing ~6 months worth of wet-lab data into one flow diagram and captures more than 5 different types of data (passage of time, genetic strains of animals, sequencing information of top drug candidates, screening results, drug characterization data, and more.)
                    
                    <br><br>During this intitative of introducing new tools into the workplace, 
                    I worked wih the research team and Curia's IT/cybersecurity department to ensure compliancy with all company and client data; 
                    and taught bash/python basics to advance the skills of older colleagues/scientists.
                    
                    <br><br>Most importantly, the interactive visualization tool can be used to track the origins of the company's products and serves as a deliverable to clients.
